# Personalized Gaming Experience with AI
This project showcases an AI-driven system that personalizes the gaming experience by adjusting game parameters and generating custom content based on player behavior. By leveraging neural networks and large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA, the system dynamically adapts to player preferences, enhancing engagement and immersion.

## Project Structure
Data Processing: Collects and normalizes player metrics and generates a world heatmap to visualize player activity.
Game Parameter Adjustment Module: A neural network model that adjusts game difficulty and player health bar based on player performance.
Content Generation Module: Uses a LLaMA language model to create personalized missions for areas of high player interest.

## Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
GPU with CUDA (recommended for running the LLaMA model)
Installation
Clone the repository:

Sign up on Hugging Face and accept the LLaMA model's license.
Download the model by running the code in content_generation.py (requires a Hugging Face access token).
Ensure the model files are accessible locally.

## API Endpoints
1. Adjust Game Parameters
URL: /adjust_parameters
Method: POST
Description: Adjusts game parameters (difficulty and health bar) based on player metrics.

Request Body:

{
  "metrics": [320, 0.75, 0.8, 0.65, 40]
}
metrics: List containing player metrics such as completion time, success rate, accuracy, resource utilization, and session duration.

Response:

{
  "difficulty_adjustment": 0.15,
  "health_bar_adjustment": -0.05
}
2. Generate Game Content
URL: /generate_content
Method: POST
Description: Generates a new mission description based on a high-interest area description.

Request Body:
{
  "area_description": "the enchanted forest"
}
area_description: Description of the area to base the mission generation on.
Response:
{
  "generated_mission": "Explore the mysteries of the enchanted forest and uncover hidden secrets."
}

## Components
Data Processing
File: data_processing.py
Functionality:
Preprocesses player metrics data.
Normalizes data for input into the neural network model.
Generates a world heatmap of player activity and identifies high-interest areas.
Game Parameter Adjustment Module
File: game_adjustment_model.py
Functionality:
Defines a neural network model (GameParameterAdjustmentNN) to predict adjustments for game parameters.
Uses player metrics as input and outputs recommended adjustments to difficulty and health bar.
Content Generation Module
File: content_generation.py
Functionality:
Loads a LLaMA model and tokenizer.
Generates custom missions based on player activity in high-interest areas, personalizing the gameplay experience.
Example Walkthrough
Adjusting Game Parameters:

The server receives player metrics as input.
The neural network model processes these metrics and returns adjustments to game difficulty and health bar.
Generating New Missions:

The server receives a description of a high-interest area.
The LLaMA model generates a mission based on this area, tailoring it to the player's preferences.
Future Improvements
Additional Player Metrics: Add more metrics for a finer-grained analysis of player behavior.
Extended Content Generation: Generate NPC dialogues, environmental details, and story arcs.
Real-Time Adaptation: Implement real-time parameter adjustments during gameplay.
UI Integration: Develop a graphical interface to monitor and manage AI adjustments.
